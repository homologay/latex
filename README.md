## Note

The template is tested on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). Let me know if it doesn't work on that compiler. I tried compiling it with `pdflatex` and I gave up pretty quickly.  

## Random

I enjoy using [Mathcha.io](https://www.mathcha.io/editor) to draw mathematical figures. I like that you can output to latex to put it right into your document, not as an image. 

## Todo

- examples using the various packages and commands
- pdf as well
