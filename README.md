# LaTeX

.. is a pretty good way to render math. It's also proof that math nerds don't know how to capitalize things 
properly. Take that, prescriptivism! 

## In this repo

* `mathtempl.tex`, a latex template for math homework that imports some packages and defines some shortcuts. 
It's not much original stuff, just what I used in school. Some of the packages I imported are pretty fun, though. 

* A few old homeworks, minus the questions (to respect my professor's copyright). Three are posted in `.tex` and `.pdf` formats. They are here to say "Hey, prospective employers! I can render math! You should hire me to write your educational materials/technical documentation!".   

## Note

All of the examples have only been tested on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). I think they should work on other compilers too, but you'd have to install the packages first. 

## Random

* If you write math with latex, you should check out `mathcha.io`. If you're a natural at hand-coding Tikz
that's very impressive, but this is so much easier.
