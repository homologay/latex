# LaTeX

.. is a pretty good way to render math. It's also proof that math nerds don't know how to capitalize things 
properly. Take that, prescriptivism! 

This repo has a few things:

* `mathtempl.tex`, a latex template for math homework that imports some packages and defines some shortcuts. 
It's not much original stuff, just a collection of things I used in school.
* A few old homeworks from school, minus the questions (oh, copyright). Three are posted in `.tex` and `.pdf` formats.
They are there mostly to say "hey, prospective employers! I can render math!".   

## Future items

* Test `.tex` files on compilers other than Overleaf
* Find the questions from the homework and include them

## Random

* If you write math with latex, you should check out `mathcha.io`. If you're a natural at hand-coding `TikZ`, I 
respect you a lot, but this is just so much easier.
