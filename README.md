## In this repo

* `homework_template.tex`, imports some packages and defines some shortcuts. It's not all original, just what I used in school.

* A few old homeworks, minus the questions (to respect my professors' copyright). Three are posted in `.tex` and `.pdf` formats. They are just here to say "Hello, prospective employers! I can render math in a pretty way, quickly. You should hire me to write your educational materials/technical documentation." 

## Note

All of the examples have only been tested on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). Let me know if it doesn't work on that compiler. 

## Random

If you write math with latex, you should check out `mathcha.io`. It's a great way to draw figures that look like they came from a textbook, and you can output to TeX to put it right into your document, not as an image.
